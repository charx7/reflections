When would you want to create a remote repo rather than a local one?
When you want to collaborate with other pople!
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because of the size of the files and internet xd
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Por si hay conflictos o cambios en la misma parte del cogido y mergearlos xd
